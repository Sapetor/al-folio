My research focuses on control systems theory and its applications, with particular emphasis on multi-agent systems and formation control. I am also an embedded systems enthusiast and I pursue their use in teaching and industrial applications. I am currently also the Director of our Computer Engineering BSc program at UAI.

Please do not heasitate to contact me (andres (dot) peters (at) uai (dot) cl) if you are interested in our postgraduate programs at UAI ([MCI - Magíster en Ciencias de la Ingeniería](https://www.uai.cl/postgrados/master-of-science/magister-en-ciencias-de-la-ingenieria) [DDS - Doctorado en Data Science](https://www.uai.cl/postgrados/doctorados/doctorado-en-data-science))

## Research Interests

My research encompasses several interconnected areas in control theory and its applications:

- **Formation Control and Vehicle Platooning**: Development and analysis of control strategies for vehicle formations, with emphasis on string stability and performance analysis under communication constraints.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Design of decentralized control algorithms for cooperative tasks, particularly focusing on simple and explainable interactions and consensus maintenance.
- **Networked Control Systems**: Analysis of control systems under communication constraints, including delays, packet losses, and stochastic perturbations.

- **Performance Bounds in Optimal Control**: Understanding the fundamental limitations imposed by structural and parametric constraints, in the achievable performance of optimal linear controllers.

## Research Grants (as PI)

## Student Supervision

I supervise both undergraduate and graduate students in research projects related to:

- Control theory and applications
- Multi-agent systems
- Robotics and automation
- String stability analysis
- Experimental validation of control algorithms
- Other random topics that amuse me such as sports related projects and Data-Driven approaches in Control and automation.
