I am an Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Engineering and Sciences, Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, Chile. My research focuses on control systems theory and its applications, with particular emphasis on multi-agent systems and formation control.

## Education
- Ph.D. in Mathematics, National University of Ireland, Maynooth (2015)
- M.Sc. in Electronic Engineering Sciences, Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María (2007)
- Electronic Engineering, Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María (2007)

## Research Interests
My research encompasses several interconnected areas in control theory and its applications:

- **Formation Control and Vehicle Platooning**: Development and analysis of control strategies for vehicle formations, with emphasis on string stability and performance analysis under communication constraints.
  
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Design of decentralized control algorithms for cooperative tasks, particularly focusing on Cucker-Smale type interactions and formation maintenance.
  
- **Networked Control Systems**: Analysis of control systems under communication constraints, including delays, packet losses, and stochastic perturbations.

## Current Projects
- **ANID/FONDECYT Iniciación (2022-2025)**: "Decentralized Formation Control of Multi-Agent Systems with Applications to Platooning Under Unreliable Communication"
  
- **Experimental Platforms**: Development of low-cost experimental setups for validation of formation control algorithms (PL-TOON and RUPU platforms)

## Student Supervision
I supervise both undergraduate and graduate students in research projects related to:
- Control theory and applications
- Multi-agent systems
- Robotics and automation
- String stability analysis
- Experimental validation of control algorithms

## International Collaboration
Active collaborations with researchers from:
- Imperial College London, UK
- Yonsei University, South Korea
- KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden
- Hong Kong City University
