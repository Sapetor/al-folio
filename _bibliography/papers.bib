  abstract = {This paper describes the implementation of a low cost experimental testbed for the study of formation control of autonomous vehicles. The purpose of the platform is to serve as an aide for the teaching of control theory, embedded systems and networked multi-agent systems at a higher education level. Simultaneously, the platform has the capability to replicate recent theoretical results for 1 dimensional platooning of unmanned autonomous vehicles and it is flexible enough to motivate new lines of research in the same area. The platform consists of several model trains powered by a 9V DC motor. Each train is equipped with a low cost microcontroller unit (MCU) with WiFi capabilities, sensors, a battery and circuitry that allow its automation. All of the parts are mounted on a 3D printed chassis. Each MCU has access to the instantaneous velocity of its train, the distance to its immediate predecessor, and some measurements of other trains through the use of the Meassage Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. Using simple Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers and a highly decentralized networking scheme, the MCUs power the DC motors in order to reach a consensus velocity and a desired formation where the vehicles maintain fixed spacings, whenever possible. The wireless capabilities of the MCU allow for supervision of the agents, data acquisition and on the fly parameter configuration. The capabilities of the testbed are showcased through experimental results.},

Using the aforementioned experimental platform, we verify that such an algorithm can improve the string stability characteristics of a set of autonomous agents traveling in a tight formation on tracks. However, we also verify that the presence of time delays in the communication is very detrimental to the collective behavior of the agents, confirming theoretical results establishing this.

  abstract = {This paper deals with the state estimation and control problem for nonlinear lateral vehicle dynamics with time delays. First, a novel time-varying delay vehicle model described as a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is presented. In particular, it is considered that the lateral force contains an air resistance term which is assumed to be a quadratic function of the lateral vehicle velocity. A time-varying delay has been included in the vehicle states by a simple formula in order to capture brake actuation aspects or other practical aspects that may generate a delayed response, while the nonlinear part of the vehicle model is described as a Lipschitz function. A Takagi-Sugeno time-delay observer-based control that satisfies the Lipschitz condition is proposed to get closed-loop stability conditions. These results generalize existing ones in the literature on lateral dynamics control. Additionally, we provide a new methodology for the controller and observer gains design that can be cast as linear matrix inequality constraints. Finally, we illustrate our results with numerical examples, which also reveal the negative effect of not considering the presence of delays in the controller design.},

We implement the proposed control algorithm in the RUPU platform, a low-cost experimental platform with wireless communication interfaces that enable the implementation of cooperative control schemes for mobile agent platooning. The experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative control scheme in maintaining a suitable performance even when subject to temporal distortions in local measurements, which, in the considered experimental setup, arise from losing the line-of-sight of the local sensors in paths with closed curves.},

We consider an homogeneous multi-agent LTI system comprised of vehicles using a predecessor follower topology and a constant time headway policy. Each agent in the string sends its current position to the immediate follower through a lossy channel modeled as a Bernoulli process. To maintain the speed of a vehicle in the event of communication loss, two control strategies are analyzed. When the data of the predecessor is not available, a first strategy uses the previously received data to estimate the lost position, while the other protocol uses the previously calculated control law. For both cases, we aim to analyze how the lossy channels affect the string stability and the overall behavior of the platoon. Through simulation results, we present the statistics of the position error and the tracking performance for different probabilities of losses and values of the time headway constant.},

We assume that each agent in the platoon sends its current position to the immediate follower through a lossy channel modeled as a Bernoulli process. To reduce the negative effects of data loss over the string stability and performance of the platoon, we use simple strategies that modify the measurement, error, and control signals of the feedback control loop, in each vehicle, when a dropout occurs. Such strategies are based on holding the previous value, dropping to zero, or replacing with a prediction based on a simple linear extrapolation. We performed a simulation-based comparison among a set of different strategies, and found that some strategies are favorable in terms of performance, while some others present improvements for string stabilization. These results strongly suggest that proper design of compensation schemes for the communications of interconnected multi-agent systems plays an important role in their performance and their scalability properties.},

The analysis is done in discrete time and, besides the saturations, we assume that that the dynamics of the local control loops are linear time invariant. As a result, we illustrate numerically how the error due to said saturations may propagate along the string, losing the string stability property of the multi-agent system. We also illustrate that the undesireable effects of the saturation may be mitigated when a simple anti- windup scheme is incorporated to deal with them.},

We discuss conditions for the stability of the full interconnected system and show that if a constant spacing policy is used, the stability of the system is lost after the string size exceeds a certain number depending on the model parameters (vehicles and controllers). Additionally, we study the use of a constant time headway spacing policy. If the associated time headway parameter is greater than a critical value, the interconnected system is stable and string stable for any string size. Finally, we show that if an independent leader vehicle is added to the formation and every follower has access to this leader position, the cyclic formation with a constant spacing policy can be made stable and string stable by appropriately selecting a design parameter.},

The solution to this problem can be obtained by several methods that frequently lead to the use of numerical techniques. This usually hides the effect that the plant characteristics have in the optimal achievable value of the objective function. Alternatively, in this paper we use Nehari's Theorem in order to obtain an eigenvalue problem that yields the optimal performance achievable with an one degree-of-freedom control loop. Given the structure of the control setup, we transform the eigenvalue problem into a non-linear equation, whose behaviour can be easily determined. The role that plant characteristics play in the achievable performance bound is made evident by this approach.},

Specifically, we conduct a set of experiments to evaluate the parameter sensitivity of the control algorithm, which corresponds to the percentage of the predecessor's velocity that could be reached by each follower during a sensing loss scenario. We find that proper tuning must be carefully performed, as excessive velocity saturation may lead to undesired behaviors due to poor tracking capabilities, whereas insufficient saturation does not improve performance during unreliable sensing episodes.

Second, it proposes persistent exciting (PE) rules for the input amplitude. This N-MRAS normalizes the information vector and identification adaptive law gains for a more straightforward tuning method, avoiding trial and error. Later, two N-MRAS designs consider estimating IM electrical and mechanical parameters. Finally, the proposed algorithm considers starting with a V/f speed control strategy, applying a persistently exciting voltage and frequency, and applying the two designed N-MRAS.
