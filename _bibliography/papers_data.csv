We consider three important interconnection topologies for vehicles travelling in a straight line as a string: leader following, cyclic and bidirectional. For the leader following topology we discuss modifications that allow reduced coordination requirements. In the first case we consider the use of the leader velocity as the state to be broadcast to the followers, rather than the standard use of the leader position. This selection yields a formation control architecture that achieves string stability even under time delays in the state broadcast, while reducing typical coordination requirements of leader following architectures. For the second modification we change the way in which the leader position is sent across the string to every follower. This technique keeps some of the good transient properties of the standard leader following architecture but eliminates most of the coordination requirements for the followers. However, we show that this technique does not provide string stability when time delays are present in the communication. The second topology that we discuss is a cyclic one, where the first member of the platoon is forced to track the last one. We discuss two strategies: one where the inter-vehicle spacings may follow a constanttime headway spacing policy and one where an independent leader broadcasts its position to every member of a cyclic platoon.

This strategy enables the followers to better deal with data dropouts. We compare this approach to one purely based on the linear extrapolation of previous data. The performance of both strategies is analyzed through Monte Carlo simulations and experiments in an ad hoc testbed, considering various data loss and transmission loss probabilities depending on the inter-vehicle distance. The results show that for the considered cases, the proposed strategy outperforms the linear extrapolation approach in terms of tracking and estimation error variances.

Commonly, such problems are solved by numerical means, making it difficult to obtain insight in the role that the parameters play on the solution. Our results provide a framework that enables to compute individually, under some simple assumptions, the eigenvalues of the matrices as roots of a monotone transcendental function with many desirable properties. In order to do so, we first obtain a three-term recursive characterization of the corresponding characteristic polynomials. This enables the aforementioned representation.
